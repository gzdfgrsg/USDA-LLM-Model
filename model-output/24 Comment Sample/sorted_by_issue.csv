The restoration is seen as crucial for environmental justice, addressing the disproportionate impact of water pollution on Tribal communities who rely heavily on fish for cultural, subsistence, and commercial purposes.

The Coalition argues that EPA's actions undermine state primacy and flexibility in setting water quality standards, which is a fundamental aspect of the Clean Water Act's structure.

They support the use of EPA-recommended relative source contributions and bioaccumulation factors because they align with sound scientific rationale and protect designated uses.
